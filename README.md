## Random Notes

- [] expect library to make simple tests
- [] deep-freeze
- [] spread operator
- [] slice to generate new arrays with changes on specific indices
- [] Object.assign to update objects
- [] a reducer must return the current state for any unknown action
- [] in the example the store is passed to the component in the view :|
- [] move sets the hero to move, but does not render
- [] probably it would be much easier to put all the sprites in a single array
- [] and then just pass them down to the view layer

- [] http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/ExampleRedditAPI.html
- [] move all actions to a separate file
- [] instead of dirty:
  - stale
  - expired
  - old
  - world changed
  - .. :(
- [] remember ({foo, bar, ...props})
- [] replace all usages of actions by action functions first
- [] move game loop into a middleware
- [] test ui using shallow rendering
- [] https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html
- [] css in js npm install radium
- [] http://projects.formidablelabs.com/radium/
- [] sufficiently local css is indistinguishable from inline styles
